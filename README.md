This repository contains a React application that demonstrates the usage of Material-UI (MUI) components along with Tailwind CSS for styling. The main focus of the code is to create a form with two input fields: "First Name" and "Last Name." The user can enter text into these fields, and the input is stored in the component's state using React's useState hook.

The form is structured using the Box component from Material-UI, providing a consistent layout. The TextField component from MUI is utilized for the input fields, with the outlined variant and value binding to the inputText state. The handleInputChange function updates the inputText state whenever the user types into the fields.

Additionally, the repository includes a button styled with Tailwind CSS classes. The button has a blue background color and transitions to red when hovered over, giving it an eye-catching effect. The text is displayed in white and changes to black when hovered over.

Overall, this project showcases the integration of React, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing form with smooth interactivity. Developers can use this code as a starting point for building similar form components in their React applications, leveraging the powerful styling capabilities of Material-UI and Tailwind CSS.
